    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
By downloading or using the app, these terms will
automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
to it, still belong to Pau Ballart.
</p> <p>
Pau Ballart is committed to ensuring that the app is
as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
charge you for the app or its services without making it very
clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</p> <p>
The TripGuru app stores and processes personal data that
you have provided to us, to provide my
Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
official operating system of your device. It could make your
phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
that the TripGuru app won’t work properly or at all.
</p> <div><p>
The app does use third-party services that declare their
Terms and Conditions.
</p> <p>

providers used by the app

You should be aware that there are certain things that
Pau Ballart will not take responsibility for. Certain
functions of the app will require the app to have an active
internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
by your mobile network provider, but Pau Ballart
cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
have any of your data allowance left.
</p> <p></p> <p>
If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
 the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
</p> <p>
Along the same lines, Pau Ballart cannot always take
responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
Pau Ballart cannot accept responsibility.
</p> <p>
With respect to Pau Ballart’s responsibility for your
use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
to provide information to us so that we can make it available
to you. Pau Ballart accepts no liability for any
loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
</p> <p>
At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
currently available on iOS – the requirements for the
system(and for any additional systems we
decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
using the app. Pau Ballart does not promise that it
will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
and/or works with the iOS version that you have
installed on your device. However, you promise to always
accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
from your device.
</p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
I may update our Terms and Conditions
from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
periodically for any changes. I will
notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
Conditions on this page.
</p> <p>
These terms and conditions are effective as of 2023-04-21

Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact me
